This is the recreation of the classic Space Invader game and it was made using the Pygame library. 
Pygame is a beginner-friendly collective of modules for game development.
This game is pretty easy to code.
To run this game follow along these steps:
          1) download the folder
          2) go one directory back from where the main.py is located and open cmd from here
          3) type the following commands          
                   pip install pygbag
                   pygbag "Space Invader"
          4) Now whatever localhost address pops up, copy that and enter it in the browser.
